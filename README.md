EventEase is a full-stack event management web application designed to simplify the planning and organization of events by connecting users with trusted service providers on a single platform. The application allows users to register, authenticate securely, and manage their sessions while exploring various event-related services such as catering, decoration, photography, and more. The goal of EventEase is to reduce the complexity involved in event planning by offering a centralized, user-friendly solution.

The platform is built using Flask as the backend framework, with MySQL serving as the relational database for storing user, service, event, and booking data. Flask-SQLAlchemy is used for ORM-based data handling in core modules, while secure authentication is implemented using password hashing and session management. The database design follows proper normalization principles, enabling scalability and efficient data retrieval as the application grows.

EventEase provides functionality for service providers to post their services along with detailed descriptions, contact information, locations, ratings, and uploaded images. Image handling is implemented using secure file upload mechanisms, ensuring only allowed file formats are stored on the server. Users can browse available services, associate them with events, and plan their requirements in an organized manner, making the application practical for real-world use cases.

The application architecture is modular and designed with extensibility in mind. Core features such as user authentication, service management, event scheduling, and database interactions are structured to allow future enhancements like service bookings, reviews, notifications, and role-based access control. This makes EventEase suitable not only as an academic project but also as a foundation for a production-ready system.

Overall, EventEase demonstrates hands-on experience in full-stack web development, including backend logic, database schema design, secure authentication, and file handling. The project reflects real-world development practices such as clean code organization, relational database modeling, and scalable system design, making it a strong portfolio project for software development and full-stack roles.
